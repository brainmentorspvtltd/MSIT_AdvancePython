Socket
Sockets let you attach the app to the local network at different ports

Basic mechanism of server-client app:
1. Client sends a request to server app
2. Server replies with a response

Basic data communication b/w client and server:
- File transfer : sends a name and gets file
- Web pages : sends a url and gets web page
- Echo : sends a message and gets it back

Server Socket
1. create a socket
2. bind to address - what port am I on?
3. listen on the port, and wait for a connection to be established
4. accept the connection from client
5. send / receive the same way we read and write for a file
6. shutdown the connection to end read / write
7. close the socket to release the port

Client Socket
1. create a socket
2. bind - this is unnecessary because you're client, not the server
3. connect to the server
4. send / receive data - repeat until we don't have or receive data
5. shutdown the connection to end read / write
6. close the socket to release the port
